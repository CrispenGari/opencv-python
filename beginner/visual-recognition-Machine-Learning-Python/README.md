# What is this?
This is a simple Machine learning app that detects classes in an image using ``ibm-watson`` Machine Learning API for
 Visual Recognition. This App also include a Tkinter GUI.
 ## Application capabilites
 * detects image classes on a given image and return the classes of images as well as score or probability of a
  certain class.
 ## packages used
 * ``ibm-watson``
 * ``tkinter``
 * ``pillow``
 * ``json``
 
## Installation of packages
### ``ibm-watson``
This package allows us to interact with ibm api to perform some `Matchine Learning Stuff` The installation is as
 follows:
 
``
$  pip install --upgrade "ibm-watson>=4.0.1"
``
### ``pillow``
This package allows us to use images in our tkinter app
``
$  python -m pip install Pillow
``
